About me
I'm a college student majoring in software engineering. In order to learn more knowledge and broaden my horizons, now I'm studying abroad in South Korea. My MBTI is INFP, and I'm full of imagination and pursue freedom. I love animals and nature, so I often go to parks alone to enjoy the peaceful environment.
